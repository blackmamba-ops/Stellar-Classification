# Stellar Classification Project

Welcome to the Stellar Classification Project! This project aims to classify stellar objects (stars, galaxies, and quasars) based on their spectral characteristics.

## Overview
In astronomy, stellar classification is the classification of stars based on their spectral characteristics. The classification scheme of galaxies, quasars, and stars is one of the most fundamental in astronomy. The early cataloguing of stars and their distribution in the sky has led to the understanding that they make up our own galaxy and, following the distinction that Andromeda was a separate galaxy to our own, numerous galaxies began to be surveyed as more powerful telescopes were built. 

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains 1 million observations and includes various features related to spectral characteristics.

## Model Selection
After testing on different algorithms, we selected the model with the best performance, achieving an accuracy of 98%. 

## Deployment
The model is deployed via local tunnel using the Streamlit framework. You can interact with the deployed application to classify stellar objects in real-time.

## Usage
Feel free to explore the notebook and experiment with different algorithms for stellar classification. If you have any questions or suggestions, please don't hesitate to reach out.
